.SH NAME
libssh2_hostkey_hash \- return a hash of the remote host\(aqs key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libssh2.h>

const char *
libssh2_hostkey_hash(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, int hash_type);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsession\fP \- Session instance as returned by libssh2_session_init_ex(3)

\fIhash_type\fP \- One of: \fBLIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_HASH_MD5\fP,
\fBLIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_HASH_SHA1\fP or \fBLIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_HASH_SHA256\fP.

Returns the computed digest of the remote system\(aqs hostkey. The length of
the returned string is hash_type specific (e.g. 16 bytes for MD5,
20 bytes for SHA1, 32 bytes for SHA256).
.SH RETURN VALUE
Computed hostkey hash value, or NULL if the information is not available
(either the session has not yet been started up, or the requested hash
algorithm was not available). The hash consists of raw binary bytes, not hex
digits, so it is not directly printable.
